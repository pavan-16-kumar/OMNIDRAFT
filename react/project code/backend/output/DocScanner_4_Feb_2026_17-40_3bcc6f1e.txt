# 3 MATERIALS MANAGEMENT
3. ①



In addition to the cost of mate-
rial 64%, inventory carrying cost
be 20% of the material cost. Thus
the total material cost will be 77% of
the sales revenue [64% plus 20% of 64%]
This shows the importance of materials
management.

Material Management will increase
the productivity of the capital by pre-
venting capital being locked up.

1. To reduce material cost which in
turn reduces the cost of the product.
2. To control inventories efficiently
3. To ensure Uniform flow of material
4. To ensure right quality and right
quantity from right suppliers.
5. To ensure maximum Utilisation.

Functions of material management.

1) Material planning
2) procurement of materials
3) Receiving and warehousing
4) Storage and Store administration
5) Inventory control
6) Standardisation, Simplification and
Value analysis

**Inventory Control:** It is a detailed list of movable goods and their control such as raw materials, materials in process, finished products and equip ments which are necessary to manufacture a product. So it a techni-que of maintaining inventories at appropriate level is knows as inventory control.

**Importanic of Materials Management**
1. It ensures smooth production flow
2. It increased Inventory turnover
3. It improves the quality of the product
4. It reduces the total production cost.
5. It uses working capital effectively
6. It uses available resources efficiently
7. It reduces Storage space.

**Reasons for maintaining inventories**
1. To stabilise production
2. To get price discounts
3. To meet demand in time of fluctuations in prices, supply.
4. To prevent loss of orders
5. pare with market conditions.

Inventory control techniques 3.(3)
1. ABC analysis
2. System of Re-ordering
3. Economic Order Quantity[EOQ]

1. ABC analysis also known as
**Always Better Control:**

ABC analysis is meant
for relative inventory control in
which maximum attention can
be given to costly items and
a fair attention can be given to
medium valued items and the
attention for low value items is
routine. This policy can be app
-lied in various other aspects of
materials management such as
purchase, Sales, inspection, invento
-ry control, store keeping, etc.,

[ABC analysis graph with axes labeled "% of inventory cost" and "PERCENT OF ITEMS".  The graph shows three sections labeled A, B, and C.]

**A-class Items:** These are high Valued
but are limited in number. They constitute
10% of items in number but the cost is
70%. of total inventory cost. So there need
careful and close inventory Control.

**B-Class Items:** These constitute 20% of
the total items and 20% of total inven
tory cost. These need moderate control.
safety stock of up to 3 months may be kept.

- class Items: These are low val
-ued, but maximum in number.
It constitute 10% of total inventory
Cost bout 70% of the total items in
number. These do not need close
control like Bolts, nuts, washers,
pins, etc... More can be purchased
at an instant.

Advantages of ABC- Analysis
1. It concentrate in areas which
need genuine control
2. It is most effective and econe
mical method
3. It helps in placing orders
4. It decides the quantity to be
purchase
5. It saves Unnecessary Stock-out
or surpluses.

System of Re-ordering: The Inventory
control technique which finds when to
place orders and for how much quantity
is the systems of reordering.
The level of material at which
new order is placed for want to material
is called Re-order Level.
The time taken by the material
to reach the industry after planting
Orders is called lead tim

During period Pa, the raw material is not available and production stopp-ed.
At point R the new order has arri-ved earlier than the material is exhausted which increase inventory cost.
In order to compensate this type of Imbalance of stock, the minimum buff-er (safety) Stock is always maintained to meet such Unexpected fluctuations

[Graph showing inventory level vs time. The graph shows a sawtooth pattern, with the inventory level increasing linearly with time until it reaches a maximum, then dropping sharply to a minimum. The x-axis is labeled "Time" and the y-axis is labeled "Inventory level". Key points are marked as "Max Stock", "Re-order level", "Mini Stock", "Buffer stock or Safety stock", "Lead time", and "Cycle time".]

# Economic order Quantity [EOQ]

Economic Order Quantity [EOQ] is the quantity of material to be ordered and purchased which is economically profitable.

In determining EOQ, two costs will be consider

1) procurement cost or Ordering cost [A/XP]
2) Inventory carrying cost [Q/2 x C]

The economic order quantity is obtained by the quantity whose procurement cost is equal to inventory carrying cost.

Total cost is the addition of procurement cost and carrying cost.

Total cost is minimum at Point A, and A' represents EOQ.

[Graph showing Total cost (c+p), Inventory carrying cost, procurement cost P, EOQ Order Quantity]

Total cost = procurement cost + Inventory carrying cost

Total cost = A/XP + Q/2 XC = √2APC

Total cost is minimum when procurement cost = Inventory carrying cost

AP/a = Q/2 XC
Q² = 2AP/C

Economic Order Quantity Q= √(2AP/C)

Find the economic order quantity
If Average annual demand=30000 units
Inventory carrying cost = 12% of the unit
Value per year, cost of placing an order=Rs.70
cost of each unit = Rs. 2.

So) CASE 1st A= 30,000 Units
C = 12% of Unit Value
= 12x2 = (12x2)/100 = Rs.0.24
P= Rs.70

EOQ= √(2AP/C) = √(2x30000x70/0.24)
= 4184 Units
Economic order Quantity EOQ=4184 Units

A=20 Units/year
P=Rs.40
cost of each unit = Rs.100
cost of carrying Inventory = 0.16
Lead time L= 3 months
Inventory carrying cost c= 0.16x100=16

EOQ= √(2AP/C)
C= Rs.16
= √(2x20x40/16) = 10 units

Re-order point = lead time x Annual
consumption per month
= (3x20)/12 = 5 Units

3.Q
Q. Annual demand of a particular product is 18,000 units. Ordering cost is Rs. 400 per order. Inventory carrying cost is Rs 1.20 per unit per year. Cost per unit is Rs 1.00.
Assume no shortages, determine.
a) EOQ
b) Number of orders per year
c) Time b/t orders
d) Total inventory cost
e) Total annual cost

Sol: Given A = 18000 units/year
P = Rs 400 per order
C = Rs 1.20 per unit per year

a) EOQ, Q = √2AP/C = √(2 * 18000 * 400)/1.2

Q = 3464 units

b) Number of orders per year = A/Q = 18000/3464 =

c) Time between orders = Q/A = 3464/18000 year
= (3464 * 365)/18000 = 70 days

d) Total cost = √2APC = √(2 * 18000 * 400 * 1.2)
= 4156.9 say Rs 4157 per year

e) Total annual cost = 18000 * 1 + 4157 = Rs. 22157/-

**Stores and Store Management:**

Unworked material is known as stores
and the place where it is housed is called
"Store Room"
Finished products are called stock
and the place where they kept is "stockroom"
Material control concerned with physical
storage of goods is known as storekeeping

**Types of Stoves:**

1.  Raw materials stores
2.  Consumable stores
3.  Inflammable stoves like petrol, kerosene,
4.  Chemical stores like carbide, H₂SO₄, etc;
5.  Machinery and equipment stoves.
6.  Inspection and **tests** measuring Instruments
7.  Finished and packages stoves

**Stores Organisation**

[Diagram showing a hierarchy: General Manager Materials Management at the top, then Stores superintendent, then Store keeper, then Store ASSE, then workers]

Store keeper is very important in the Organisation and is responsible for the articles in his charge. He will take steps to reduce wastage and thefts.

Stores location: While locating the
stores the size of the industry to
which it is attached is taken into
account. Stores may be located as.
1. Centralised stores 2) Decentralised stores
1. Centralized Stores: If there are several
manufacturing departments, the store
room is situated near to all depart
ments to reduce manual work.
2. Decentralised Stores: In large fac
-tories there are several departments,
each using a different type of materials.
It becomes beneficial to separate the
stores. It is known as decentralised stores

Functions of stores department and
Duties of a store keeper.
1. To get all kinds of materials and
equipments from the camps.
2. To ensure a regular supply of materials
to the stores.
3. To check stores to make sure they
are in good order.
4. To keep stock systematically
5. To issue the items to authorised
requests.

**Carden Method:** The most popular manual check-in method for materials is Cardex. It refers to the cards that store detailed information about materials or components. Cardex provides a quick and easy way to record and retrieve materials. The cardex unit itself a compact cabinet with about 15 drawers and each drawer can hold up to 60 individual cardex cards. So each cardex unit can contain information about 900 materials.

It contain information about:
a) What should be purchased
b) by whom should it be made
c) at what rate
d) when the material be delivered?

**Purchasing Management:**
Purchasing is the procurement of goods or services from an external supplier. The main purpose of purchasing department is to arrange the supply of materials, spare parts and services for manufacturing products. So more attention should be paid to the economical and systematic procurement of materials.

**Objectives of purchasing Department:**
1. To get right material in time.
2. Must suitable material for quality proc
3. To get quality services at low cost.
4. To ensure a continuous flow of materials.
5. Ensures reliable sources of supply.
6. To ensure better profit margins.
