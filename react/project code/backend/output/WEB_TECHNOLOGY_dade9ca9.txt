**Java Script**

- Java Script is a client side Scripting language & it allows creating dynamic webpages.

- Scripting language is used to enhance the features of websites,

- The data which is transfer from Client System to Server System, in client Server Communication Controlled of with help of Java Script.

Need for client side Scripting:

language

- client side scripting language can be used to make website more interactive.

- It reduces the load on the server Machine,

- It Validating all the user input.

- It allows client server programmers to be accessed remotely.

Various client side scripting languages

- Thar are various side types of scripting languages given below.
    - Html
    - in cesrotan ⚠️unclear_word⚠️
    - thail Javascript
    - React JS
    - Angular.

Html Html

It is Markup language not a programming language. It is a most basic language for client surver web programming.
- Html standi - to hyper text markup language.
- Hyper text refers to page contain hyper links. Markup language refers to tag to discribe the layout and structure of the ⚠️unclear_word⚠️ document.

Css
Css - transtor cascading styling sheet.
- These are used to anabt - the webpage developers ⚠️unclear_word⚠️ add ⚠️unclear_word⚠️ style.

- A styles element in webpage.
- Specifies the presentation of the webpage like color, front, border, font size, Margin, Padding, height, and width.

**Java Script**

Java Script client side scripting language and it allows creating dynamic webpage. It is light weight and most commonly used has a part of webpage.

- In Java script the special tag `<script>` is used in the head or body section.

It is used around 97% of webpage like mozilla firefox, google chrome, Microsoft internet explorer, Microsoft edge, safari and other ⚠️mageal⚠️ web - browsers are supported.

**Xhtml**

Xhtml is transistor extensible hyper text markup language it is a clear version of html.

It is a next generation of html?
It is almost identical to html.

Various operators in Java Script

Operators are the symbols used Hod
Perform various operations on operanca
Java Script supports eight types of
- Operators this are,
1. Arithmetic operators
2. Comparision operators
3. Logical

4. Assignment
5. SerString
6. INTREit - wide
7. Tamary operators
8. Typed

_Arthemelic Operators_

- Arthemetic operators are used to perform
mathematical calculations like. Addition,
Substraction, Multiplication, division & Modulus
etc

| No. | Operator | Operator Name | Example (let x = 6 & y = 2) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. | + | Addition | x + y ; result = 8 |
| 2. | - | Substraction | x - y ; result = 4 |
| 3. | x | Multiplication | x * y ; result = 12 |
| 4. | / | Division | x / y ; result = 3 |
| 5. | % | Modulus | x % y ; result = 0 |
| 6. | ** | Exponentiation | x ** y ; result = 36 |
| 7. | ++ | Increment | a = x++ result = 9 <br> = 6 x = 7 <br> b = ++y result = b <br> = 3 y = 3 |
| 8. | -- | decrement | c = x-- result = c <br> 6 x = 5 <br> d = --y result = <br> d = 1 y = 1 |

_Assignment Operators_

- Assignment operator are used to assign the values of expression resultand to variables

---

## Page 6

| S.No | Operators | Example | Same as | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. | `=` | `x = 4` | `x = y` | The lat op ends gets set to the value of th. expression on the appl |
| 2. | `+ =` | `x += 4` | `x = x + y` | Addition of x & y assigne to x |
| 3. | `- =` | `x -= 4` | `x = x - y` | Subtraction x & y assigne to x |
| 4. | `* =` | `x *= 4` | `x = x * y` | Multiplication of x & y assi -ned to x |
| 5. | `/ =` | `x /= 4` | `x = x / y` | Division of x & y assi -ned to x |
| 6. | `%=` | `x %= 4` | `x = x % y` | Modulus of x & y assigne to x |
| 7. | `** =` | `x **= 4` | `x = x ** y` | Exponentiation of x & y assigned to |

Logical operators

Logical operators are used to next the
logic between the variables or
values and written through the true
or false as the result.

| S.No | Operator | Operator Name | Example | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. | && | Logical AND | x && y | True if both x & y are true. |
| 2. | \|\| | Logical OR | x \|\| y | True if either x or y is true |

## Page 12

Bitwise operators:
are used to perform the operation at bits level.

Before a bitwise operation is Performed Javascript converts numbers to 32 bits signed integers and then perform the operation.
-After the bitwise operation is performed the result is converted back to 64 bits Javascript numbers.

| No. | Operator | Description | Example | Same as | Result (Binary) | Result (Dec) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. | `&` | Bitwise AND | 5&3 | 0101 & 0011 | 0001 | 1 |
| 2. | `\|` | Bitwise OR | 4\|1 | 0100 \| 0001 | 0101 | 5 |
| 3. | `~` | NOT | ~2 | ~0010 | 1101 | 13 |
| 4. | `^` | XOR | 5^1 | 0101 ^ 0001 | 0100 | 4 |
| 5. | `<<` | left shift | 4<<1 | 0100 << 1 | 1000 | 8 |
| 6. | `>>` | right shift | 5>>1 | 0101 >> 1 | 0010 | 2 |

# Comparison Operators: Comparison operators
are used to compare two values and returns true or false as result.

| Operator | Operator Name | Example (let x = 10) | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. `<` | less than | x < 10 | False |
| 2. `<=` | less than or Equal to | x <= 10 | True |
| 3. `>` | Greater than | x > 5 | True |
| 4. `>=` | Greater than or equal to | x >= 5 | False |
| 5. `==` | Equal to | x == 5 x == 10 | False true |
| 6. `!=` | Not equal to | x != 5 | True |

Ternary operator:- Ternary operator is also called as Conditional operator
at assign a value to the variable, or execute one expression among two.
based on the result of test (Condition).

Conditional Statements in Javascript:

Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

In Javascript we have the following four Conditional statements:
1) `if` statement 2) `if else` statement
3) `else if` statement 4) `switch` statement

Here are the Conditional statements in Javascript:

`If` statement: Used to execute a block of code if a condition is true.

`if (condition) {`
`// code to be executed`
`}`

E = rodmun
E = rodmuh
E = rodmuh trappist
```

of _if-else_ statement :- used to execute
a blocks of code if a condition as
true, and another block of code if
the condition as false

if (Condition){
|| code to be executed if condition as
true.
} else {
|| code to be executed if condition as
false
}

of _if-else if_ statement :- used to
Check multiple conditions and executed
different block if code if
if (Condition){
|| code to be executed if Condition 1 as
true
} else if (Condition 2) {
|| code to be executed if condition 1
as false and condition 2 as true
} else {
|| code to be executed if all condition
are false
}

of _Switch_ statement :- Used to execute
different blocks of code based on
different cases.

---

## Page 18

```markdown
Switch (expression) {
Case value 1:
// Code to be executed at expression
Matches value 1
break;

Case value 2:
// code to be executed and expression
matches value 2.
break;

default:
// code to be executed and expression does
not match any value.
}

Nested if else statement:- When if
block or else block contains another if
Statement or if else statement then the
Construct as said to be "Nested if else
Statement!

Syntax of nested if else statement is
Given below:-

if (expression 1)
{

# Loops:
Iterative statements | Repetitive statements

- Executing one or more statements, repeated is called looping.
- A loop is used to execute some code many number of times.

Iterative statements / loop in Javascript.
Javascript language supports three types of iterative loop structure.
- They are:

(a). While iterative statement in Javascript.

While loop: In while loop initially the condition is checked & if it is true then only loop statements will be executed.

The syntax general form of the while loop is:

```
while (expression)
{
  statement 1;
  statement 2;
}
```

⚠️unclear_word⚠️ ⚠️unclear_word⚠️ ⚠️unclear_word⚠️
Statement ⚠️unclear_word⚠️ ⚠️unclear_word⚠️ ⚠️unclear_word⚠️
⚠️unclear_word⚠️ ⚠️unclear_word⚠️ ⚠️unclear_word⚠️ ⚠️unclear_word⚠️ ⚠️unclear_word⚠️
Not statement.

  Sum = Sum + i;
  i++;
}
document.write("The Sum: " + Sum);
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

Output: The Sum is 55

b) DO-while iterative statement in Javascript:

DO-while loop: In do-while loop, initially the blocks of statements are executed & after execution of only the condition. There statements.

---

## Page 27

The Symbol - General form of the do-
while loop is.

```
do
{
  Statement 1;
  Statement 2;
  Statement N;
}
while (Expression);
next statements;
```

Write a Javascript program to find the sum of first 10 natural numbers.

document.write ("The sum is " + sum);
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

Output: The sum is 65.

## Page 28

c) for _Iterative_ statements:

- for loop: The for loop consist of three expression in it.

The first expression:- Is called Intialisation expression & is used to check wheather the loop is to be continued or not;

The third expression:- Is called the second Condition expression & is used to check wheather the loop is to be continued or not;

The third expression:- (Increment/decrement) as used to change index value for the next enterations the
