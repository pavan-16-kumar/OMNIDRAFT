### Various Operators in Java Script

Operators are the symbols used to perform various operations on operands.

Java Script supports eight types of operators. They are:

1. Arithmetic operators
2. Comparison operators
3. Logical
4. Assignment
5. String
6. Bitwise
7. Ternary operators
8. Typed

# Arithmetic Operators

## Overview of Arithmetic Operations

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical calculations like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division & Modulus etc.

---

| No. | Operator | Operator Name | Example (Let x = 6 & y = 2) |
|-----|----------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| 1.  | +        | Addition      | x + y; Result = 8           |
| 2.  | -        | Subtraction   | x - y; Result = 4           |
| 3.  | x        | Multiplication| x * y; Result = 12          |
| 4.  | /        | Division      | x / y; Result = 3           |
| 5.  | %        | Modulus       | x % y; Result = 0           |
| 6.  | **       | Exponentiation| x ** y; Result = 36          |
| 7.  | ++       | Increment     | a = x++; Result = 9         |
|     |          |               | = 6, x = 7                  |
|     |          |               | b = ++y; Result = b         |
|     |          |               | = 3, y = 3                  |
| 8.  | --       | Decrement     | c = x--; Result = c         |
|     |          |               | 6, x = 5                    |
|     |          |               | d = --y; Result =           |
|     |          |               | d = 1, y = 1                  |

| 2. | += | x += 4 | x = x + y | Addition of x & y assign to x |
| 3. | -= | x -= 4 | x = x - y | Subtraction x & y assign to x |
| 4. | *= | x *= 4 | x = x * y | Multiplication of x & y assigned to x |
| 5. | /= | x /= 4 | x = x / y | Division of x & y assigned to x |
| 6. | %= | x %= 4 | x = x % y | Modulus of x & y assigned to x |
| 7. | **= | x \*\*= 4 | x = x \*\* y | Exponentiation of x & y assigned to |

# Bitwise Operators

## Bitwise Operation Details

Bitwise operators are used to perform the operation at bits level.

Before a bitwise operation is performed, Javascript converts numbers to 32 bits signed integers and then performs the operation.

After the bitwise operation is performed, the result is converted back to 64 bits Javascript numbers.

---

| No. | Operator | Description | Example | Same as | Result (Binary) | Result (Decimal) |
|-----|----------|-------------|---------|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| 1.  | `&`      | Bitwise AND | 5 & 3   | 0101 & 0011 | 0001            | 1                |
| 2.  | `\|`     | Bitwise OR  | 4 \| 1  | 0100 \| 0001 | 0101            | 5                |
| 3.  | `~`      | NOT         | ~2      | ~0010     | 1101            | 13               |
| 4.  | `^`      | XOR         | 5 ^ 1   | 0101 ^ 0001 | 0100            | 4                |
| 5.  | `<<`     | Left Shift  | 4 << 1  | 0100 << 1  | 1000            | 8                |
| 6.  | `>>`     | Right Shift | 5 >> 1  | 0101 >> 1  | 0010            | 2                |

# Comparison Operators in JavaScript

## Understanding and Implementation

Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return *true* or *false* as a result.

---

| Operator No. | Operator Name          | Example (let x = 10) | Result  |
| :------------ | :----------------------- | :--------------------- | :------ |
| 1.            | < Less than              | x < 10                 | False   |
| 2.            | <= Less than or Equal to | x <= 10                | True    |
| 3.            | > Greater than           | x > 5                  | True    |
| 4.            | >= Greater than or equal to | x >= 5                 | False   |
| 5.            | == Equal to              | x == 5 x == 10         | False True |
| 6.            | != Not equal to          | x != 5                 | True    |

## Conditional Statements in Javascript:

Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

In Javascript we have the following four conditional statements:
1) `if` statement
2) `if...else` statement
3) `else if` statement
4) `switch` statement

Here are the conditional statements in Javascript:

### `if` Statement:
Used to execute a block of code if a condition is true.

```javascript
if (Condition) {
  // code to be executed
}
```
```

---

## Page 17

```markdown
# Conditional Statements

## Code Execution Logic

---

`if-else` statement: used to execute a block of code if a `Condition` is true, and another block of code if the `condition` is false.

```
if (Condition){
    // code to be executed if condition is true.
} else {
    // code to be executed if condition is false
}
```

---

`if-else if` statement: Used to check multiple conditions and executed different block of code if:

```
if (condition 1) {
    // code to be executed if condition 1 is true
} else if (condition 2) {
    // code to be executed if condition 1 is false and condition 2 is true
} else {
    // code to be executed if all conditions are false
}
```

---

`switch` statement: Used to execute different blocks of code based on different cases.
```
```

{
Statement block -3;
}
else
{
Statement block -4;
}
}
```

---

Write a **Javascript program** to determine whether the *number* is "even or odd" using `if` Statement :-

```html
<html>
<body>
<script>
var n = 100;
if (n % 2 == 0)
{
document.write ("Even number");
}
if (n % 2 != 0)
{
document.write ("Odd number");
}
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

---

> **Output:**
>
> -Even number.

  }
  else
  {
    document.write ("c is largest");
  }
}
else
{
  at (b>c)
  {
    document.write ("b is largest");
  }
  else
  {
    document.write ("c is largest");
  }
}
</script>
</body>

```

---

**Output:**

> c is largest

---

of *else if ladder statement*: The *else if ladder statement* is used when there are many choices (Condition) and control has to select one choice among all jobs.

# Loops

## Iterative Statements / Repetitive Statement

- Executing One or more statements, repea-ted is called **looping**.

- A loop is used to excute some code many number of times.

Iterative statements / loop in Javascript.

Javascript language supports three types of Iterative loop structure.

- They are:

(a). While Iterative statement in Javascript.

While loop: In while loop initially the Condition is checked & if it is true then only loop statements will be executed.

The syntax general form of the while loop is:

```
while (Cexpression)
{
Statement 1;
Statement 2;
}
```

      document.write("The Sum is " + Sum);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

---

> **Output:**
> The Sum is 55

---

b) DO-while iterative statement in Javascript:

DO-while loop: In do-while loop, initially the blocks of statements are executed & while are executed after execution of only the condition. There statements.

---

## Page 27

# Code Snippets & Logic Flows

## Do-While Loop Structure

The Symbol - General form of the do-while loop is:

```
do
{
    Statement 1;
    Statement 2;
    Statement N;
}
while (Expression);
next statements;
```

---

</script>
</body>
</html>
```

---

Output: The Sum is 65.

## Page 28

```markdown
# Iterative Statements

## For Loop Details

- For loop: The for loop consist of **three expressions** in it.

---

### First Expression

The first expression: Is called **initialization expression** & is used to check whether the loop is to be continued or not.

---

### Second Expression

The third expression: Is called the **Condition expression** & is used to check whether the loop is to be continued or not.

---

### Third Expression

The third expression: (Increment/decrement) is used to change index value for the next iterations.

---

### Syntax

Syntax (General form for loop) is:

```
for (expression 1; expression 2; expression 3) {
    Statement 1;
    Statement 2;
    ...
    Statement N;
}
```

---

> **Pro-Tip:** Remember to properly initialize, condition, and increment/decrement your loop variables!
