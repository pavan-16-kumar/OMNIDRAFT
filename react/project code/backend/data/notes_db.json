The only 36% cost is for wages and salaries, overhead and profit, etc.\n\nIn addition to the cost of material 64%, inventory carrying cost be 20% of the material cost. Thus the total material cost will be 77% of the sales revenue [64% plus 20% of 64%]. This shows the importance of materials management.\n\nMaterial Management will increase the productivity of the capital by preventing capital being locked up.\n\n---\n\n## Objectives of Material Management\n\n1.  To reduce material cost which in turn reduce the cost of the product.\n2.  To control inventories efficiently.\n3.  To ensure uniform flow of material.\n4.
